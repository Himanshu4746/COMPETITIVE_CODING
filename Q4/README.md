We have N strings of length N.
All the strings are binary.
All the N strings can be generated by a string S by performing right rotations N times.
For example if S is "101", then the strings in the bag will be "110", "011" & "101".
Find out the number of ways of selecting one string out of N strings with an odd decimal equivalent.

Input:
The first line consist of an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of an integer denoting N.
Second line of each test case consists of a binary string denoting S.

Ouptut:
Print the answer for each test case in a new line.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^5
