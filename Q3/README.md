The DNA molecule consists of a long strand of chemical bases wound together with a similar strand in a double helix. 
It's four constituent bases—adenosine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine combine with each other only in the following ways:

Cytosine links only with guanine, and vice versa.
Adenosine links only with thymine, and vice versa.
We abbreviate the names of the bases by writing the initial letter: A, C, G, or T.

Find out whether and where the smaller strand will make a DNA.

Input:

First line contain the number of TEST CASES, next line contains big STRAND and small STRAND.

Output:

It contains "YES at index" at which it is found, if 2nd strand makes a DNA molecule.

"NO" if it doesn't.

Constraints:

0 < T <= 20

0 < big STRAND <= 10^6

0 < small STRAND <= 10^6
